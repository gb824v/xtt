  <!-- advertDisplaySeconds is used by the optional advert insertion module.
  
     It is used by the insertAdvert workflow. When that workflow decides to insert an interstitial 
     advert, it tells the advert servlet to set the refresh headers in the advert to display the advert f
     or the time specified by this workflow constant.-->
  <workflowConstant name="advertDisplaySeconds">2</workflowConstant>

  <!-- ageIsUnknownUrlis used by the optional content filtering module.

     It is used by the filterContent workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be 
     redirected if the request is blocked because the subscriberâ€™s age is not known. -->
  <workflowConstant name="ageIsUnknownUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/AgeUnknown.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- alwaysBlockUrl is used by the optional content filtering module.

     It is used by the filterContent workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be 
     redirected if the request is blocked because it matches a global filter. -->
  <workflowConstant name="alwaysBlockUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/AlwaysBlock.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- bannerPath is used by the optional advert insertion module.
  
       It is used by the replaceBanner workflow. It identifies the servlet that you want to call to 
       supply the banner advert content. This is a servlet that is running in a WEB-APP process.  The 
       value is what you would normally type as the path on the URL. The rest of the URL is automatically 
       generated. -->
  <workflowConstant name="bannerPath">advert/banner</workflowConstant>

  <!-- blockApplicationRetryAfter is used by the optional application update control module.

       Set this workflow constant if you want XMP to set the HTTP Retry-After header when it 
       blocks an application update with error 503 (server busy). This header gives a hint to the 
       sender of the HTTP request to say when it might be worth re-trying the request. It tells 
       the sender how long to wait (in seconds) before sending the request again.
       If this workflow constant is missing, XMP does not set the Retry-After header. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockApplicationRetryAfter">600</workflowConstant>

    <!-- blockApplicationUpdateNames is used by the optional application update control module.

       Set this workflow constant if you want XMP to display an interstitial application update 
       preferences page to find out which updates the subscriber wants to block. It configures the 
       list of names that are passed to the servlet that implements the application update preferences 
       page.
       
       The reference servlet displays these names on the application update preferences page, with 
       a checkbox beside each name that the subscriber checks if they want to block that application 
       update.
       
       The value is a list of names separated by vertical bars. Each name must consists of only 
       alphanumeric characters, and space and underscore characters. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockApplicationUpdateNames">Apple|Flash player|Java|Microsoft</workflowConstant>

  <!-- blockApplicationUpdatePath is used by the optional application update control module.

       Set this workflow constant if you want XMP to display an interstitial application update 
       preferences page to find out which updates the subscriber wants to block. This is the path 
       part of the URL of the application update preferences page. The rest of the URL is 
       automatically generated.

       If this workflow constant is missing, then XMP blocks all configured application updates 
       and does not display an interstitial application update preferences page.  -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockApplicationUpdatePath">/appupdate/preference</workflowConstant>

  <!-- blockedBySystemFiltersUrl is used by the optional content filtering module.

  <!-- blockedByVirusScannerUrl is used by the optional virus scanner module.

     It is used by the handleHttp workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be redirected
     if the request is blocked because it has a virus.
     The handleHttp workflow checks whether the value returned in KSPRSKY_Result is "INFECTED" or 
     "NOT_CURED", and if so, redirects the request to the URL defined by blockedByVirusScannerUrl. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockedByVirusScannerUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/Virus.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- callStatchlet is a boolean that controls whether the STATCHLET component is called. 
        This component is in HTTP-PROXY and TCP-ROUTER processes. If the value is "true",

        It is called just before the request modification rules for the HTTP request phase are applied.
        
        The STATCHLET component is not called if the constant is not defined in the workflow 
        constants file or it is "false".

  <!-- ldapGetSubscriberIdKey is used only if you have enabled support for LDAP to be used as the presence feed.

     This constant is used by the getSubscriberId workflow if you use the LDAP presence feed. The workflow 
     makes an LDAP query called GetSubscriberId to find out the subscriber ID associated with the subscriberâ€™s
     IP address. 

     This workflow constant says which attribute returned by the LDAP server contains the subscriber ID. The 
     workflow copies the value of this attribute to the Internal_NAI context element.   -->

     It controls whether XMP sends a CCR-T message to the PCRF after sending it the RAA-T message.  The value 
     can be â€œtrueâ€? or â€œfalseâ€?. If this context element is absent, XMP behaves as if it had been set to â€œfalseâ€?. -->
  <workflowConstant name="pcefDisableSessionControlCcrt">false</workflowConstant>

  <!-- pcrfEnableSmsNotifications is used by the optional PCRF module.

     It controls whether the diameterInProcess workflow can send SMS messages.  It specifies whether the

  <!-- videoOptimizationFailureRetriesMax is used by the new video optimization engine in versions
     after XMP 4.1.4. -->
  <workflowConstant name="videoOptimizationFailureRetriesMax">1</workflowConstant>  

  <!-- videoOptimizationFailureRetentionSecs is used by optional video optimization module.

     This controls what happens when the offline transcoder attempts to transcode a video but the 
     attempt fails, for example because the TCP connection failed or the offline transcoder could not 
     handle the content because it was invalid.
     
     XMP keeps the offline transcoding task item in the store for failed conversions because otherwise 
     a VOE process might add the same item again and the offline transcoder will try to optimize the 
     video again and the attempt to optimize the video will fail again if the problem is that the video 
     content is invalid.
     
     You use this workflow constant to configure how long an offline transcoding task item when the 
     attempt to transcode the item offline failed. The value of this workflow constant must be an integer 
     greater than or equal to 1. If this workflow constant is not defined, or you set it to an invalid value, 
     a default value of 604800 seconds (1 week) is used.
