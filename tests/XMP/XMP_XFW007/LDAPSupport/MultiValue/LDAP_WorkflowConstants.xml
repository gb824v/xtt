<workflowConstants>

  <!-- advertDisplaySeconds is used by the optional advert insertion module.
  
     It is used by the insertAdvert workflow. When that workflow decides to insert an interstitial 
     advert, it tells the advert servlet to set the refresh headers in the advert to display the advert f
     or the time specified by this workflow constant.-->
  <workflowConstant name="advertDisplaySeconds">2</workflowConstant>

  <!-- ageIsUnknownUrlis used by the optional content filtering module.

     It is used by the filterContent workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be 
     redirected if the request is blocked because the subscriber’s age is not known. -->
  <workflowConstant name="ageIsUnknownUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/AgeUnknown.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- alwaysBlockUrl is used by the optional content filtering module.

     It is used by the filterContent workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be 
     redirected if the request is blocked because it matches a global filter. -->
  <workflowConstant name="alwaysBlockUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/AlwaysBlock.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- bannerPath is used by the optional advert insertion module.
  
       It is used by the replaceBanner workflow. It identifies the servlet that you want to call to 
       supply the banner advert content. This is a servlet that is running in a WEB-APP process.  The 
       value is what you would normally type as the path on the URL. The rest of the URL is automatically 
       generated. -->
  <workflowConstant name="bannerPath">advert/banner</workflowConstant>

  <!-- blockApplicationRetryAfter is used by the optional application update control module.

       Set this workflow constant if you want XMP to set the HTTP Retry-After header when it 
       blocks an application update with error 503 (server busy). This header gives a hint to the 
       sender of the HTTP request to say when it might be worth re-trying the request. It tells 
       the sender how long to wait (in seconds) before sending the request again.
       If this workflow constant is missing, XMP does not set the Retry-After header. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockApplicationRetryAfter">600</workflowConstant>

    <!-- blockApplicationUpdateNames is used by the optional application update control module.

       Set this workflow constant if you want XMP to display an interstitial application update 
       preferences page to find out which updates the subscriber wants to block. It configures the 
       list of names that are passed to the servlet that implements the application update preferences 
       page.
       
       The reference servlet displays these names on the application update preferences page, with 
       a checkbox beside each name that the subscriber checks if they want to block that application 
       update.
       
       The value is a list of names separated by vertical bars. Each name must consists of only 
       alphanumeric characters, and space and underscore characters. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockApplicationUpdateNames">Apple|Flash player|Java|Microsoft</workflowConstant>

  <!-- blockApplicationUpdatePath is used by the optional application update control module.

       Set this workflow constant if you want XMP to display an interstitial application update 
       preferences page to find out which updates the subscriber wants to block. This is the path 
       part of the URL of the application update preferences page. The rest of the URL is 
       automatically generated.

       If this workflow constant is missing, then XMP blocks all configured application updates 
       and does not display an interstitial application update preferences page.  -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockApplicationUpdatePath">/appupdate/preference</workflowConstant>


  <!-- blockedByCommunityFiltersUrl is used by the optional content filtering module.

     It is used by the filterContent workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be 
     redirected if the request is blocked because it matches a community filter. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockedByCommunityFiltersUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/CommunityFilters.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- blockedByPersonalFiltersUrl is used by the optional content filtering module.

     It is used by the filterContent workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be 
     redirected if the request is blocked because it matches one of the subscriber’s personal filters. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockedByPersonalFiltersUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/PersonalFilters.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- blockedBySystemFiltersUrl is used by the optional content filtering module.

     It is used by the filterContent workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be 
     redirected if the request is blocked because it matches an age-based filter. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockedBySystemFiltersUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/SystemFilters.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- blockedByVirusScannerUrl is used by the optional virus scanner module.

     It is used by the handleHttp workflow. It specifies the URL to which a request is to be redirected
     if the request is blocked because it has a virus.
     The handleHttp workflow checks whether the value returned in KSPRSKY_Result is "INFECTED" or 
     "NOT_CURED", and if so, redirects the request to the URL defined by blockedByVirusScannerUrl. -->
  <workflowConstant name="blockedByVirusScannerUrl">http://www.telco.com/Blocked/Virus.html</workflowConstant>

  <!-- callStatchlet is a boolean that controls whether the STATCHLET component is called. 
        This component is in HTTP-PROXY and TCP-ROUTER processes. If the value is "true", 
        the STATCHLET component is called for HTTP requests processed by the handleHttp workflow. 
        It is called just before the request modification rules for the HTTP request phase are applied.
        
        The STATCHLET component is not called if the constant is not defined in the workflow 
        constants file or it is "false".
        
        For more information, see the chapter on statistics in the book "Operator Handbook: Monitoring" -->

           *  “none”
           *  "pcrf"
           *  “radius”
        Before the authentication phase reqmod rules are applied, the workflow copies the value of 
        this workflow constant (if it exists) to FTR_AuthenticationType.  -->
  <workflowConstant name="defaultAuthenticationType">ldap</workflowConstant>
  
  <!-- diameterSubscriptionIdType is used by the optional PCEF and PCRF modules.
  
     You use it to specify which Subscription-Id AVP in the incoming Diameter message contains the 
     subscriber ID. It contains the value of the Subscription-Id-Type that is associated with the 
     subscriber ID.  -->
  <workflowConstant name="diameterSubscriptionIdType">END_USER_E164</workflowConstant>  

  <!-- enableWurfl is a boolean that controls whether WURFL support is enabled. It is disabled by default.  
        To enable it, set enableWurfl to "true". -->

  <!-- interstitialPath is used by the optional advert insertion module.
  
       It is used by the insertAdvert workflow.  It identifies the servlet that you want to call to supply the 
       interstitial advert content. This is a servlet that is running in a WEB-APP process.  The value is what you 
       would normally type as the path on the URL. The rest of the URL is automatically generated. -->
  <workflowConstant name="interstitialPath">advert/interstitial</workflowConstant>

  <!-- ldapGetSubscriberIdKey is used only if you have enabled support for LDAP to be used as the presence feed.

     This constant is used by the getSubscriberId workflow if you use the LDAP presence feed. The workflow 
     makes an LDAP query called GetSubscriberId to find out the subscriber ID associated with the subscriber’s
     IP address. 

     This workflow constant says which attribute returned by the LDAP server contains the subscriber ID. The 
     workflow copies the value of this attribute to the Internal_NAI context element.   -->
  <!--workflowConstant name="ldapGetSubscriberIdKey">CHLDAP_QueryLDAPEntries/0/msisdn</workflowConstant-->
  <workflowConstant name="ldapGetSubscriberIdKey">CHLDAP_QueryLDAPEntries/[AttrName=Msisdn]/Value</workflowConstant>

  <!-- ldapValiditySecs is used only if you have enabled support for LDAP to be used as the presence feed.

     It says how long data read from the presence store is valid for, when the data was obtained from an LDAP 
     server. After this time, the data is read again from the LDAP server. 
     
      When a subscriber’s session ends, it is essential that their IP address is not re-assigned to another 
     subscriber within the period configured by the ldapValiditySecs workflow constant. We recommend 
     that you allow a large margin of safety and that the system does not re-use an IP address until twice 
     the time configured by ldapValiditySecs has elapsed since the end of the original subscriber’s session. -->
  <workflowConstant name="ldapValiditySecs">10</workflowConstant>
  <workflowConstant name="noAuthValiditySecs">10</workflowConstant>

  <!-- notificationSmsChannel is used by the optional content filtering and PCRF modules.

     It is used by the filterContent and diameterInProcess workflows. It is the name of the SMS channel to use 
     to deliver SMS messages. -->
  <workflowConstant name="notificationSmsChannel">SmsChannel</workflowConstant>

  <!-- notificationSmsConnection is used by the optional content filtering and PCRF modules.

     It is used by the filterContent and diameterInProcess workflows. It is the name of the SMS connection to 
     use to deliver SMS messages. -->

  <!-- pcefCcrMaxRetries and pcefCcrRetryIntervalSecs are used by the PCEF module.
  
      They configure the retry policy that is implemented if XMP sends a CCR message to the PCRF and does 
      not get a response.  See also the description of pcefUserIdPrefix below. -->
  <workflowConstant name="ppcefCcrMaxRetries">1</workflowConstant>
  <workflowConstant name="pcefCcrRetryIntervalSecs">5</workflowConstant>

  <!-- pcefDisableSessionControlCcrt is used by the PCEF module's subscriber session control use case. 
 
     It controls whether XMP sends a CCR-T message to the PCRF after sending it the RAA-T message.  The value 
     can be “true” or “false”. If this context element is absent, XMP behaves as if it had been set to “false”. -->
  <workflowConstant name="pcefDisableSessionControlCcrt">false</workflowConstant>

  <!-- pcefUserIdPrefix is used by the PCEF module's subscriber session control use case. 
 
     If it is set, and XMP sends a CCR-I message to obtain the subscriber ID and the PCRF does not respond 
     after the retries configured by pcefCcrMaxRetries, then XMP generates a dummy subscriber ID by 
     prefixing the subscriber's IP address with the specified string. -->
  <workflowConstant name="pcefUserIdPrefix">999_</workflowConstant>

  <!-- pcrfEnableSmsNotifications is used by the optional PCRF module.

     It controls whether the diameterInProcess workflow can send SMS messages.  It specifies whether the

     or "false" (don’t call the customizePcrfSendSms workflow).-->
  <workflowConstant name="pcrfEnableSmsNotifications">false</workflowConstant>

  <!-- pcrfSmsOutOfCreditMessage is used by the optional PCRF module.

     It is used by the customizePcrfSendSms workflow, which is called by the diameterInProcess workflow. 
     It is the default text of the SMS message that is sent when an OUT_OF_CREDIT event occurs. -->
  <workflowConstant name="pcrfSmsOutOfCreditMessage">You have run out of credit. You can top up your credit by visiting http://www.telco.com/topup</workflowConstant>
  
  <!-- pcrfSmsSourceAddress is used by the optional PCRF module.

     It is used by the diameterInProcess workflow. It is the source (from) address to use in the outgoing 
     SMS messages. -->
  <workflowConstant name="pcrfSmsSourceAddress"></workflowConstant>
  
  <!-- pcrfValiditySecs is used used only if you use the optional PCEF module. It is used by the PCEF 
     module's session control use case.

     It says for how long the subscriber ID to subscriber IP address mapping information is valid that is 
     supplied by the PCRF. After this time, XMP sends the PCRF a Diameter CCR update message to request
     the mapping information again. 
     
     When a subscriber’s session ends, it is essential that their IP address is not re-assigned to another 
     subscriber within the period configured by the pcrfValiditySecs workflow constant. We recommend 
     that you allow a large margin of safety and that the system does not re-use an IP address until twice 
     the time configured by pcrfValiditySecs has elapsed since the end of the original subscriber’s session.-->
  <workflowConstant name="pcrfValiditySecs">180</workflowConstant>

  <!-- proxyThrottlingMaxRetryIntervalSecs is used if you use the throttling dynamic 
     configuration file to configure throttling policies for pull requests sent to 
     proxy servers.
     
     It is a decimal number that specifies how long the workflow can spend implementing
     retry logic when a request matches a throttling limit.  -->
  <workflowConstant name="proxyThrottlingMaxRetryIntervalSecs">0</workflowConstant>

  <!-- Push_SmsChannel is used only if you have configured push support.

     It is the name of the SMS channel to use to deliver push messages via SMS. -->
  <workflowConstant name="Push_SmsChannel">SmsChannel</workflowConstant>

     It is the name of the SMS connection to use to deliver push messages via SMS. -->
  <workflowConstant name="Push_SmsConnection">SmsConnection</workflowConstant>

  <!-- radiusValiditySecs is used only if you have configured a live RADIUS feed.

     It says how long data read from the presence store is valid for, when the data was obtained from a RADIUS 
     feed. After this time, the data is read again from the presence store. 
     
      When a subscriber’s session ends, it is essential that their IP address is not re-assigned to another 
     subscriber within the period configured by the radiusValiditySecs workflow constant. We recommend 
     that you allow a large margin of safety and that the system does not re-use an IP address until twice 
     the time configured by radiusValiditySecs has elapsed since the end of the original subscriber’s session.-->
  <workflowConstant name="radiusValiditySecs">180</workflowConstant>

  <!-- subscriberInfoValiditySecs is used by the getSubscriberId workflow.

     It says how long the subscriber profile data is valid for. After this time, the subscriber profile data is 
     read again, for example from the XMP database. -->
  <workflowConstant name="subscriberInfoValiditySecs">600</workflowConstant>
  
  <!-- videoOptimizationFailureRetriesMax is used by the new video optimization engine in versions
     after XMP 4.1.4. -->
  <workflowConstant name="videoOptimizationFailureRetriesMax">3</workflowConstant>  

  <!-- videoOptimizationFailureRetentionSecs is used by optional video optimization module.

     This controls what happens when the offline transcoder attempts to transcode a video but the 
     attempt fails, for example because the TCP connection failed or the offline transcoder could not 
     handle the content because it was invalid.
     
     XMP keeps the offline transcoding task item in the store for failed conversions because otherwise 
     a VOE process might add the same item again and the offline transcoder will try to optimize the 
     video again and the attempt to optimize the video will fail again if the problem is that the video 
     content is invalid.
     
     You use this workflow constant to configure how long an offline transcoding task item when the 
     attempt to transcode the item offline failed. The value of this workflow constant must be an integer 
     greater than or equal to 1. If this workflow constant is not defined, or you set it to an invalid value, 
     a default value of 604800 seconds (1 week) is used.
